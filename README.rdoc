== State Machine Play

I need to use a state machine in a new project and am having a play.

I've decided that finite_machine is the tool to use:

At the moment, this is very simple: just a Job model with a business
process defined within JobProcess. JobProcess defines a FiniteMachine that
is associated with Job.

This allows me to separate the process rules out from the model, and use
the Finite Machine splendidness.
